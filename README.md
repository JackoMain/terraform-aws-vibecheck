# terraform-aws-vibecheck
A framework for an aws test app with IaC

I reverted some things to comments since they may
possibly be utilized later. Currently, these things
aren't essential to the code in its current
iteration. 

This is primarily a way for me to practice provisioning
in aws using terraform. Looking at tutorials for 
terraform, there was a lot I had to adjust because 
of features that deprecated. On the bright side,
I know how to peruse through Hashicorp's
documentation!
